# Predictive-D1-Retention

This is a personal project in order to learn more about concepts, python and the most important libraries to create prediction models, as well as how to do data preparation and analysis.
In this case, I chose to do it also thinking of a real business application. Working in the gaming industry, I realized that users are very dynamic, so I set out to think, how can we retain the player according to their first day of play (D0)?
This analysis allowed me to know which were the events that had the most positive impact on player retention, as well as to create a predictive model.
